        The Dialogue Platform was developed for institutions that are accountable to complex publics: city governments, universities, independent research centres, and multi-stakeholder coalitions. It is grounded in the belief that dialogue is not a single event or a generic consultation, but a structured practice that shapes how problems are defined, how options are surfaced, and how commitments are made. The platform brings together methods from systems thinking, dialogue theory, and institutional design to provide a shared language for clarifying mandates, surfacing assumptions, and articulating the boundaries of what a given dialogue can and cannot decide.
