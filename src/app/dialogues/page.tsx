        Dialogues in the platform are defined by their purpose, composition, and relationship to decision-making. Each format is documented so that participants, facilitators, and institutional sponsors share a clear understanding of why they are meeting and what can be expected from the process. The platform supports assemblies, working groups, interviews, and online sessions as coherent parts of a single architecture, with outputs structured as insights—patterns, tensions, and hypotheses—that can be revisited, contested, and connected to policy and program work.
